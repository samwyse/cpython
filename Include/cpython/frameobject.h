# Layout of locals, cells, frees, stack in current CPython:

| fastlocals        | cells             | frees             | stack             |

+-- f_localsplus    +-- f_cellvars                          +-- f_valuestack

If we move the stack next to the locals, we can treat the locals+stack
as a contiguous register file. ISTR Tim Peters saying in the old
rattlesnake days that the number of registers would be no greater than
the max stack size. This will eliminate LOAD_FAST_REG and
STORE_FAST_REG opcodes which should be a good performance win.

| fastlocals        | stack             | cells             | frees             |

+-- f_localsplus    +-- f_valuestack    +-- f_cellvars

This requires some adjustment to the offset to the start of cell and
free variables. My first attempt failed miserably. On my second
attempt, I added the above f_cellvars slot to the _frame struct and am
proceeding more carefully.  It took a bit of effort to work this out,
but I think it's working now (tests pass, at least). See
_PyFrame_New_NoTrack.

It wasn't obvious to me why cells and free vars were added adjacent to
locals. It does seem that in certain places, locals, cells and frees
are all treated as one, so having them adjacent in memory makes things
a touch simpler, but separating into separate for loops (for example)
isn't much extra work, mostly confined to frameobject.c.
