        #
        # The BUILD_LIST_REG instruction requires that its inputs be in
        # registers %r3 through %r5.  Accordingly, the two LOAD_FAST_REG
        # instructions used to (partially) construct its inputs must be
        # preserved.  BUILD_TUPLE_REG and CALL_FUNCTION_REG will have
        # similar implicit references.  Other instructions might as well.
        # One way to deal with this might be to identify such implicit
        # uses and mark the corresponding LOADs as "protected."  Then
        # execute the normal forward propagation code, skipping over those
        # LOADs.
        #
        # This example is more challenging:
        #
        # def _tuple(a):
        #     return (a, a+2, a+3, a+4)
        #
        # Note that the LOAD_FAST_REG of the initial 'a' won't
        # immediately precede the BUILD_TUPLE_REG instruction. The
        # various expression evaluations separate them.  Instead of
        # just looking at the immediately preceding instr.length
        # instructions and marking LOAD_FAST_REG as protected, we need
        # to look at the last writes to all registers between
        # instr.dest and instr.dest+instr.length
        #
        # I've hacked something together here.  Not sure it's entirely
        # correct (it's certainly still incomplete, failing to
        # consider calls at this point), but the failing test passes,
        # so we're done. :-)
